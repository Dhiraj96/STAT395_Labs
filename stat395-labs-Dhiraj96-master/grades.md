Overall, your labs show that you have been following the core
methods in the class and are able to apply them in both direct
and creative ways to the various datasets at hand. Your exposition
around the text is generally at the right level, but in the future
please put these comments *outside* of the code block rather than
embedded as comments within the code (it is hard to read that way
and defeats the purpose of the R notebooks). Otherwise, keep up
the good work!

Overall, a good job on this second set of labs. You continue to mostly
get good predictions on the test set and always provide enough
exposition showing that you understand the results and describing
what & why you are applying the given techniques. However, I don't
seem to have a lab16 in any format from you. Please make sure to
hand in the assignments on-time in the final push of the semester.

Great work on this last set of labs and throughout the semester.
Looking forward to seeing your final project!
