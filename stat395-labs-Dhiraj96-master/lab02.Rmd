## Instructions

The format for this lab will mirror the majority of labs for
this semester. I have a section here which loads in various
libraries (if some are new, there will also be code to install
them) and then loads a dataset of interest. Your goal is to
predict the value of the third column (which will be missing
on the test set) using the techniques we have learned so far.
In this case, please restrict yourself to univariate linear
regressions. 

The lab should be written as short code snippets with surrounding
text. The text should be in full sentences and should fully describe
what and why you are running the code you are running.  When there
are results, you should also give a sentence or two describing them.

Make sure to include at a minimum several plots and argue for why
you chose your final model.

You may not share code with other students prior to the submission
of each lab. However, discussing the labs amongst other students
is allowed. Also, copying and pasting my code from class or 
prior submissions you made is **not** considered plagiarism and
is in fact highly encouraged. With permission, I may occasionally
post student-solutions to past labs. These are also fair game
for copying code from (though please do not excessively copy the
expository text). If in doubt, please ask me before submitting
results.

## Set up

Your first step should be to read in the following libraries:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
```

And to load the abalone dataset:

```{r}
abalone <- read_csv("https://statsmaths.github.io/ml_data/abalone.csv")
```

An abalone is a particular type of shellfish; I find it rather
funny looking:

Your goal is to use physical characteristics from a set of abalone
to predict the shellfish's age.

Your code and text should go in the section below (feel free to create
sub-sections with the `###` command at the start of line, though please
note that this is not required):

## Lab 02

THIS IS WHERE YOUR CODE AND TEXT SHOULD GO (and please remove this line!)

```{r}
#Looking at what variables to use
#First, let us check whether there is a difference in weight between male, female and i categories
#We can see that the male and female abalone spread is relatively the same, but the i category has slightly less variance and is on average less than the other two categories.

boxplot(age~sex, data=abalone)



```
```{r}
#To test this significance, we can run the following regression
model1 <- summary(lm(age~sex, data=abalone))
model1
#we can see from this model that the I category does have a statistically significant lower mean than the female and male groups to the 99.9th percentile, indicating we may want to include age as a predictor in our linear model
  #One thing to keep in mind with a one-way anova is to check whether or not sample sizes are the same. The following code below does that and indicates the sample sizes are relatively close to each other

occurences <-table(unlist(abalone))
occurences["M"]
occurences["F"]
occurences["I"]

```
```{r}
#Next we can do a simple correlation table to give us a better idea of what to include/not include in predicting age of the abalone(using only complete observations)
  #We do this by first creating a data frame with only the variables we are interested and omitting the NA age values (only using our training data)

Corr_table <- data.frame(abalone)
Corr_table$obs_id <- NULL
Corr_table$train_id <- NULL
Corr_table$sex <- NULL

Corr_table <- na.omit(Corr_table)
cor(Corr_table)

#From the following we can see what correlations are especially high so we can avoid a kitchen sink linear regression model
#length and diameter are highly correlated, as are total weight and shucked weight, viscera weight and sheel weight. 
```
```{r}
#Finally, we can create a stepwise regression to determine what variables to include in predicting age, keeping in mind the very high correlations of the variables above since we want to avoid multicollinearity

Regression_table <- abalone
Regression_table$obs_id <- NULL
Regression_table$train_id <- NULL

#This will allow us to reference the columns in the Regression_table with their explicit names
#We exclude shucked, viscera and sheel weight since they are all highly correlated to total_weight
attach(Regression_table)
model <- step(lm(age~sex+length+diameter+height+total_weight),direction = "both")
model

summary(model)

```
```{r}
#Finally we use the fitted values for age prediction and store the values into our a column
abalone$age_pred <- predict(model, Regression_table)
```
## Submission

The code below assumes that you have adding a prediction named
`age_pred` to every row of the `abalone` dataset. 

```{r}
#We then store this column as well as the observation id's into an excel file
submit <- data.frame(abalone$obs_id, abalone$age_pred)
colnames(submit) <- c("obs_id", "age_pred")
write_csv(submit, "class02_submit.csv")
```

Now, upload this file (ends with ".Rmd"), the HTML output
(ends with ".nb.html"), and the csv file to GitHub.
