# Statistics 395: Lab Files

This repository is where you will find my submissions for a variety of labs
I was tasked with estimating for my Statistical Learning class at the 
University of Richmond.The main purpose of the course was to explore various 
statistical models for the purpose of prediction (both global and local models). 

Some of the more interesting topics we learnt during this course include
Linear, Multivariate & Multinomial regression, Nearest Neighbours clustering
and classification, Elastic Nets (or Ridge/Lasso hybrid models), Tree based
models (Gradient Boosted Trees & Random Forests), Neural Network Models (
Dense, convolutional, reccurent) and Transfer Learning. This class spent little time 
discussing the internals of many of these models but instead focused on how 
to apply these models to many varieties and flavors of data. 

We also touched on more qualitative topics such as evaluating model selection
techniques, generating equivalent ways of assessing prediction accuracy, 
cross validation techniques, and feature extraction for NLP in text as 
well as image data. This class also briefly touched on Visualization techniques
such as principal components analysis and t-SNE for linear and non-linear 
dimensionality reductions.
