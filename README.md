# Stat395_Labs
Labs/Assignments for Stat 395 class taken at University of Richmond (Fall 2017). The files are named by each lab number 
in sequential order. Each lab submisssion consisted of a R markdown file (.Rmd), an html knitted file and a .csv file
containing the prediction results (which were pre-split into training, validation and test data). We were given the 
training and validation data results but the test data was hidden from us (so the instructor had an accurate method
of assessing our models with data it had not seen before).
