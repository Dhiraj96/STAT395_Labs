# My Projects
Here you will find folders of all my completed coding related projects. Currently there is just one repo that contains the assignments/projects I worked on during my Statistical Learning Class at the University of Richmond. I am also currently working on various trading related statistical studies that will be posted up in due time. 


## Stat395_Labs
Labs/Assignments for Stat 395 class taken at University of Richmond (Fall 2017). The files are named by each lab number 
in sequential order. Each lab submisssion consisted of a R markdown file (.Rmd), an html knitted file and a .csv file
containing the prediction results (which were pre-split into training, validation and test data). We were given the 
training and validation data results but the test data was hidden from us (so the instructor had an accurate method
of assessing our models with data it had not seen before).
